This application will calculate Grade Point Average(GPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average(CGPA) to assist student or any user that need their GPA and CGPA by the end of the semester. 
A student’s Grade Point Average is the weighted mean value of all grade points he/she earned by enrollment, or through credit by examination, in a semester/session of attendance at university. 
Grade Point Average(GPA) is the calculation which is used at the end of a semester. The GPA is the key to calculate the student performance which is evaluated by the lecturer or authorized person. There are two input areas where the end-user or the student requires to enter the data. 
The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is the overall GPA of the entire academic year at the university. The CGPA is considered as the final performance report for a student. There are four input areas where the end-user or the student requires to enter the data:

 - Previous total credits completed

 - Previous CGPA, not GPA

 - Total credits taken in this semester

 - GPA achieved (Current Semester)
